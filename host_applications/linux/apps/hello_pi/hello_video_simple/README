To stream with low latency from camera.

To set up camera server than runs from boot, on "camera" pi, run
sudo cp raspi-vid /etc/init.d; cd /etc/init.d; sudo chmod +x raspi-vid; sudo update-rc.d raspi-vid defaults

Alternatively to just launch on demand, run
./raspi-vid start  

The camera server is based on suggestion from: https://drjohnstechtalk.com/blog/2014/02/screaming-streaming-on-the-raspberry-pi/

On the "display" pi run
nc 192.168.0.101 5001 | ./hello_video_simple

Streams with about 200ms latency and low cpu.
